<header>Welcome to Cystic Fibrosis Now!</header>

<p>This website was created to help people with cystic fibrosis become more aware of others with cystic fibrosis that may be attending the same school to help avoid cross-infection.  As a parent of a child with cystic fibrosis I feel like I am extra concerned about the importance of health, safety and privacy.  We know that we cannot always protect our children from all germs and cross-infection, but some situations and circumstances we can.</p>
<p>This is a completely voluntary way of letting others with cystic fibrosis know what school you are attending, while keeping all your infomation (name, email, address, phone number, etc.) completely anonymous.  As you search for schools, you may see that there is another person with CF attending the school.  It is recommended in this situation that you click on the school, and then click on the "Send Message" button that will then allow you to send an e-mail to the other person with cystic fibrosis at that school.  You can follow the <a href="https://www.cff.org/Living-with-CF/CF-and-School/Working-with-Your-Childs-School/When-There-s-More-Than-One-Person-With-CF-in-the-Same-School/">CF Foundations recommendations </a> and coordinate any special planning to avoid cross-infections.</p>  
<p>This website is not connected with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but I strongly recommend visiting and following their guidelines.  As a reminder, we will send a yearly reminder by e-mail for you to either update or delete your information as children change grades or schools.  Thank you for using this website!</p>
